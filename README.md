The main objective of these projects is to display the use of SQL and critical thinking in tackling everyday business concerns.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> ℹ️ The Data </h2>

##### The databases are proprietary to *Data with Danny* so there is no code/script for creating them, here.
 
 *Data with Danny* provides it's data via a development environment composed of a postgres database server (on which the databaes are already created and populated) and an SQLPad GUI for accessing and querying the databases. This environment can be accessed in two ways:
 1. deploying the serious-sql-environment github repository on gitpod.
 2. deploying the serious-sql-environment container locally on Docker.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> 🛠️ Tools and Technologies </h2>

- **SQL**: For querying and transforming data.
- **Database**: Relational databases (PostgreSQL).
The use of containers for setting up the databases ensures that these projects are entirely focused on (postgres) SQL

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> 🏛️ Repo Structure </h2>

Each case study has its own folder with a `README.md` that explains what it is about and how it was handled.
