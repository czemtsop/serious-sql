# Marketing Analytics Case Study

## 1. üìöÔ∏è Introduction
This Case Study focuses on leveraging SQL to prepare data for a marketing campaign and derive actionable insights. The goal is to help a DVD rental business engage customers on an individual level, based on their past behavior.

### 1.1 üóùÔ∏è Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze customer demographics, rent patterns, and engagement metrics.
- **Communication**: Prepare data for email to present insights effectively.


### 1.2 Outcomes

- Improved understanding of customer behavior.
- Customised marketing emails based on data insights.
- Optimized campaign performance and ROI.

### 1.3 Requirements Analysis

The DVD Rental Co marketing department has requested for help getting the data needed to fuel their first ever customer email campaign. They shared a template of the email they will send to each customer and after analysing it, we have a broad idea of what data we need to provide. We have split these main requirements into 9 major insights, for each customer.

The table below summarises our observations on each insight.

| Insight | Description   | Remark     |
| --------| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 and 4 | Top (most watched) 2 categories.     |   -         |
| 2 and 5 | Some statistics based on the categories identified in (1) & (4) | - |
| 3 and 6 | Film recommendations based on the categories identified in (1) & (4) | - The recommended films should not have been watched by the customer and no film in (3) should repeat in (6).<br>- Flag customer if no recommendation for either (3) or (6) |
| 7 | Favourite actor | Choose in alphabetic order if there are ties  |
| 8 | Some statistics related to the favourite actor identified in (7) | - |
| 9 | Film recommendations based on the favourite actor identified in (7) | - No film in (3) or (6) should be found here.<br>- Flag customer if there's no film recommendation|
 
 ## 2. The Data

The data for this problem is available in the DVD Rental Co database and the tables needed are shown in the entity relationship diagram (ERD) below.

We observe that all these tables are linked by foreign keys, though not directly. 

| Tables  | Preferred Join | Remark      |
| --------| -------------- | ----------- |
| 1 and 2 | Inner join     |  We need each record to be in both tables because:<br>- If a rental operation is done in (1) without a matching inventory in (2), it must be an accident and we can't use that data.<br>- An inventory (2) not rented (1) is not useful for our analysis |
| 2 and 3 | Inner join    |  |
| 3 and 4 | Inner join    |  |
| 4 and 5 | Inner join    |  |
| 3 and 6 | Inner join    |  |
| 6 and 7 | Inner join    |  |
